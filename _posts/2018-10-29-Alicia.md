On the 29th of October session, [Alicia](https://biological-sciences.uq.edu.au/profile/981/alicia-toon) gave a beautiful explanation of how to do phylogentics analysis with the **BEAST**.
 
Alicia's slides are available [here](/pdf/2018-10-29-Alicia.pdf) and documentation about `BEAST` [here](http://beast.community/).
