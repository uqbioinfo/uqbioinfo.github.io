In November [Maddie](https://biological-sciences.uq.edu.au/profile/747/maddie-james) gave us all an excellent and in-depth guide to SNP filtering from NGS data for population genetics analysis
 
Maddies slides are available [here](/pdf/2018-11-21-Maddie.pdf) and 'vcftools' documentation can be found [here](https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html).
