title: DAPC in `adegenet`
---

On the 28th of April session, [Josh]() made a nice and easy demo of how to use `adegenet` in `R` for easy population genetics pipeline analysis: "From SNPs to structure: population genetic analyses using R's adegenet function".
 
Josh's slides are available [here](/pdf/2019-03-28-Josh.pdf) and documentation about `adegenet` [here](https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet).
